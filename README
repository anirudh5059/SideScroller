Dependencies:

The app requires the development libraries for SDL2 and SDL2_Image.
The app is tested on the linux environment.
For ubuntu repositories, the requisite packages are called libsdl2-dev
and libsdl2-image-dev respectively, thus running the following commands
resolves both dependencies.

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev

Building:

The project has a single makefile in the source directory.  If you are on a
linux based system, simply running 'make' builds all requirements and creates
an 'app' file which can be run.

Running:

Simply execute the 'app' object created.
